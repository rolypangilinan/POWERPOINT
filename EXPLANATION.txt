JED PROGRAM:
SLIDE 1
Inspection CheckSheet Recording System
Purpose: The purpose of this System is to digitize the current checksheet Recording system.
Rather than saving to an excel file

IN SHORT, WE modernize and digitize the existing checksheet recording process by transitioning from manual, spreadsheet-based methods (like Excel) to a digital, web-based platform

Additional Features:
Super Admin:
FULL CONTROL OF THE WHOLE SYSTEM, IT CAN CREATE A NEW USER ACCOUNT, CRUD
OPERATOR:
IF THE OPERATOR WANTS TO OPEN FILES IT WILL BE IN READ ONLY DEFAULT MODE
SO THAT THE OPERATOR CAN NOT EDIT OR UNEXPECTED DELETE THE FILES

How it works?
SO ALL OF THESE DATA INCLUDING ANNEALING, TEMPERATURE, TORQUE WILL ALSO HELP OUR AI'S PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS. SO FOR YOU TO KNOW WE DO HAVE AN IMPROVED AI INSIDE THE MATERIAL DETECTOR AND WE CALLED IT "SCIKIT LEARN" JED WAS THE FIRST WHO USE THIS KIND OF AI.
I WILL SHOW YOU THAT THIS AI IS REALLY LEARNING. I WILL GIVE YOU 2 KINDS OF PROGRAM THAT HAS BOTH AI WHICH IS THE SCIKIT LEARN
SO THE FIRST PROGRAM IS THE MATERIAL DETECTOR AND AS YOU CAN SEE AS PER PYTHON'S CONSOLE OUTPUT ALL MATERIAL WAS VERIFIED FROM PROCESS 1 UP TO PROCESS 6 AND HAS NO FOUND ERROR, THAT'S WHY SCIKIT LEARN VALIDATION GIVE 100 %
BUT BASE ON THE 2ND PROGRAM WHICH IS OUR FUTURE PROGRAM AS YOU CAN SEE IT GIVES ME A LOWER PERCETAGE OF 39.9%. MEANING TO SAY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE DATA LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. TOO FEW DATA TO GATHERED OR IT IS CAUSE BY HUMAN ERROR LIKE TYPO GRAPHICAL ERROR. SO I THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE SCIKIT LEARN IS PERCENTAGE IS REALLY 100 PERCENT TRUE. 


OUTPUT TAG LABEL PRINTER 
TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS INCLUDE LOT # AND ITEM CODE








CARL PROGRAM : VISION
DATASET
SO IN THE FIRST IMAGE THESE ARE ALL THE COMPLETE MATERIAL SET PER UNIT AND WE WILL CALL IT DATASET
DATASET IS THE IMAGES THAT PYTHON NEEDS TO LEARN AND IT NEEDS 100-200 IMAGES SO THAT IT WILL HAVE A HIGH PERFORMANCE IN OBJECT DETECTION BUT IN REVERSE IF WE ONLY HAVE A FEW IMAGES FOR EXAMPLE 50 IMAGES ONLY IT WILL LEAD TO POOR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE YOLO WILL ONLY MEMORIZE THE 50 IMAGES WITHOUT TRULY UNDERSTANDING THEM14 COMPARE TO 200 IMAGES THAT YOLO IS REALLY LEARNING RATHER THAN MEMORIZING. THESE IMAGES ACT AS THE "TRAINING MATERIALS"

-LABEL STUDIO
ITS USED FOR ANNOTATION
SO WHAT IS ANNOTATION AND HOW IT WORKS 
SO THERE'S A SMALL VIDEO THAT WILL SHOW HOW TO WORK ON INSIDE THE LABEL STUDIO
-ULTRALYTICS
THIS IS USED FOR IMAGES LEARNING
AFTER LABELING THE IMAGES AT LABEL STUDIO IT WILL BE EXPORT TO ULTRALYTICS SO THAT IT WILL LEARN THE 200 IMAGES AND THE OUTPUT WILL BE A FILE THAT HAS AN EXTENSION FILENAME OF ".PT"
SO IF YOU WILL RUN YOLO APPLICATION WHICH IS THE CAMERA THAT CAN DETECT AN OBJECT ULTRALYTICS WILL READ THE .PT THAT 

This is the codebase for learning the annotated dataset currently running in google collab
SO CARL USES A GOOGLE COLLAB JUST TO RUN THE YOLO APPLICATION
A GOOGLE COLLAB IS JUST ANOTHER COMPUTER FROM ONLINE THAT CAN BE USED TO RUN THE YOLO APPLICATION BECAUSE THIS ONLINE COMPUTER HAS A GOOD GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT OR THE GPU THAT CAN ABLE TO RUN THE YOLO APPLICATION BECAUSE CARLS PC DOESN'T HAVE A GOOD GPU TO RUN THE YOLO APPLICATION


This is the codebase for object detection
SO AS YOU CAN SEE WHEN YOLO PACKAGE HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO PYTHON IT DOESN'T HAVE A SCRIPT ALREADY 
MEANING ITS NOT LIKE DOWNLOADING AN APPLICATION THAT HAS ALREADY A SCRIPT OR CODE
SO IN YOLO YOU NEED TO PROGRAM EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH IN ABLE TO CREATE AN APPLICATION
